This is our repo for the second faze of the Computer Network project.
The main problem tackled here is client-server file communication using raw JS. 

The communication is both UDP and TCP based however since JS is a web scripting language its raw TCP permissions are not allowed by most present day browsers so inevitably it will be turned into web socket communication.
